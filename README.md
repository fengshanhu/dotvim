These are my highly customized vim configurations.

## Installation
See into ``install.sh`` and you'll figure out how to install.

If you don't need [YCM](http://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/) or if you don't have proper version of libclang installed in your system, please ignore the lines in ``install.sh`` and compile YCM yourself. For the details, please see the doc of YCM.

See ``vimrc`` for details on my configurations.
